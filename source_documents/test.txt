Air Pollution Control Measures

•	Coal companies are deploying modern equipment having environment friendly features, like Surface Miner in coal, which eliminates the drilling, blasting and crushing operations in coal and hence, in turn, obviates pollution caused due to these operations. In an effort to introduce blasting free clean
 
coal technology in underground mines Continuous miner are being deployed in UG mines to minimize blasting vibration. Similarly, High Wall mining is also introduced for blast less coal mining. More than 52% of coal produced in OC mines is through Surface miners and more than 34% of coal produced in UG mines is through Continuous miners in FY 2021-22. CIL has also planned to augment coal production from underground mines by commissioning additional 39 Continuous Miners, 4 Power Support long Wall (PSLW) and 4 High Wall projects by 2025-26.
•	First Mile Connectivity (FMC): CIL has taken steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading system under 'First Mile Connectivity' projects. In FY 2019-20, CIL has taken up new 35 (thirty-five) First Mile Connectivity (FMC) Projects of 414.5 MTPA capacity at an estimated capital of about Rs 10,750 Cr and scheduled to be commissioned by FY2023-24. These 35 FMC Projects are in addition to the already existing First Mile Connectivity (FMC) capacity of 151 Mty. Out of these 35 FMC Projects, 6 Projects of 82 MTPA capacity has already been commissioned. With commissioning of all these 35 FMC Projects, CIL shall have a Rapid Loading Capacity of 555 MTY for loading into Railway wagons, by FY2024.
•	Presently CAAQMS have been installed in 65 locations in CIL to monitor the pollution load, additional 38 are under process for procurement / installation.

•	The dust is controlled at source by installation of fixed sprinklers at CHPs, coal stock yards, weighbridges and along transportation roads. In major CHPs, fixed sprinklers have been provided at the transfer points and bunkers. CIL has installed about 5,682 nos. of fixed sprinklers in its mining areas. Additionally, 162 fog cannons have also been installed in major opencast mines of CIL.

•	Mobile water sprinkler are also deployed along the haul roads. CIL has deployed 850 mobile water sprinkler tankers in its large open cast mines.
•	Effective plantation in the  mine lease area has been done to arrest the propagation and dispersion of dust significantly.
•	Coal companies are having drills fitted with wet drilling and dust extractors in order to control generation of dust.
 
•	Quantum of coal transported by conveyors to siding is being continuously increased to minimise generation of dust due to road transportation.
•	Controlled blasting techniques with proper delay detonators and explosives are utilized for reduction of dust generation and ground vibration during blasting operations.
•	The quality of ambient air in and around the mine is monitored every fortnight as per Environment (Protection) Amendment Rule.
•	Roads are black-topped, coal carrying trucks are optimally loaded and covered with tarpaulin.
•	Tree plantation:
i.	Plantation on inactive OB Dumps is done to minimize soil erosion;
ii.	Tree Plantation is done around the source of air pollution like mine, infrastructure and roads to reduce air pollution;
iii.	Green belt has been provided around the mine as well as residential colony for noise attenuation;
Keeping above objectives in view, extensive tree plantation programme is undertaken every year by the coal companies. Avenue plantation, plantation on the OB dumps, plantation around mines, residential colonies, and available land is undertaken in existing as well as new projects.

Water Pollution Control Measures

•	Garland drains around mine have been constructed to collect runoff water and siltation ponds for silt collection.
•	Mine effluent are treated in settling tanks before discharging /re-use which is used in residential colonies, adjoining villages, industrial purposes & irrigation.
•	In OC mines, 123 Effluent treatment plants (ETP) have been commissioned for treatment of effluents.
•	In colonies, 45 Sewage treatment plants (STP) have been commissioned for treatment domestic sewage.
•	Water re-circulation system has been implemented in washeries to achieve zero discharge of effluents.
 
•	Sumps of mines are rainwater harvesting structures and help in ground water recharge. Apart from this, commissioned 440 rain water harvesting projects in CIL.

Noise Pollution Control Measures:

•	Proper maintenance of equipment are done to minimize vibration.
•	Green belt around the mine and residential area has been created to minimize the impact.
•	Controlled Blasting is being practiced which substantially reduces the noise pollution.
•	Use of blasting free technology, i.e. Surface Miner, Continuous Miner & High Wall mining etc are being used and continuously being promoted.
•	Ear Muff or Ear Plugs are provided to Workers to mitigate the adverse impact of noise pollution on health of workers.

Land Reclamation

•	For reclamation, plantation in the mining areas covering the solid waste as well as the reclaimed land is carried out through State Forest Development Corporations as per the provisions made in the approved EIA/EMPs. The density of plantation is 2.500 sapling per ha. It may be worthwhile to mention here that for every 1 ha of forest land diverted for coal mining projects, about
2.5 ha of afforestation has been developed in the mine area.
•	CIL has planted more than 104 lakh of saplings over an area of more than 4391 Ha in inside mine lease area and around 10.82 lakh saplings over an area of more than 808 Ha in outside mine lease area during last five years i.e. from FY 2017-18 to FY 2021-22. CIL & its Subsidiaries have planned to carry out plantation over about 6,800 Ha. for 5 years (i.e. from 2021-2026).
•	For FY22-23 as on 15.11.2022, CIL undertook plantation of 29.30 Lakh saplings over 1526 Ha against target of 1510 Ha.
•	Regular monitoring of land reclamation is also carried out through remote sensing technique (Satellite imagery). In case of Major OC mines (with excavation more than 5 MM3) the frequency of monitoring is annual and for
 
other mines the monitoring is carried out once in 3 years. In addition, monitoring of Coalfield wise vegetation cover is also done once in 3 years.
•	Study during 2021-22 shows that 76 major OCPs have 62.53% area under reclamation and active mining area is only 37.47 % of the total excavated area.
•	On comparing the status of land reclamation carried out in year 2020-21 with respect to year 2021-2022 in the major 76 Opencast projects of different subsidiaries of CIL, it is evident from the analysis of satellite data that area under land  reclamation has  increased from 173.95  Km2  (Yr.  2020-21) to
189.25 Km2 (Yr. 2021-22), which includes both area under plantation and area under backfilling. This increase of 15.30 Km2 area of land reclamation in last one year is the result of the efforts made by CIL’s subsidiary companies towards land reclamation.

Waste Management:
(a)	Hazardous Waste Management: In compliance of Hazardous & Other Waste (Management & Trans boundary Movement) Rules, 2016 Authorization from respective SPCBs is taken for disposal of Hazardous Waste.

Promoting Renewable

In order to minimize the carbon footprints of mining, CIL is keen on promoting renewables. CIL is going for both roof top solar and ground mounted solar projects. It has also been envisaged to develop solar parks in some of the reclaimed mining areas. CIL has already installed 11.967 MW of solar power plants, of which 2 MW of is ground mounted and 9.967 MW rooftop plants. CIL has programmed to install 3,000 MW of solar power projects by 2023-24 which will create a CO2 offset potential of 3.936 million Tonne per year.
 
Energy Efficiency measures

Efficient use of energy resources and their conservation assume tremendous significance as one unit of energy saved at the consumption level reduces the need for fresh capacity creation by 2 times to 2.5 times. Further, such saving through efficient use of energy can be achieved at less than one-fifth the cost of fresh capacity creation. Most importantly, energy conservation also translates into reduction of carbon footprint.

CIL has signed MOU with EESL to implement Energy Efficiency Programs at CIL and Subsidiaries. This shall cover Building Energy Efficiency Projects (BEEP), Replacement of old fans, ACs and conventional light fittings, motors, adoption of e- vehicle, installation of distributed and rooftop solar projects.

Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018:
•	Against the diversion of the forest land required for the mining project, compensatory levies are being deposited in the CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) and with State Forest Departments.
•	Subsidiaries of CIL have deposited more than Rs. 585.43 crores towards CA & NPV payment in Ad-hoc CAMPA account against forest land diverted for non- forestry purpose during last three years i.e. from 2019-20 to 2021-22.

Mine Closure Guidelines 2008, 2013 & 2020
Mine closure plan is an integral part of the project report for Coal mines. CIL's goal is to achieve its coal production target sustainably and ensure land usage for future
 
generations after final closure of the mine. Mine closure guidelines have been issued by MoC in 2008 and subsequently revised in 2013 and 2020.
As on date, Rs. 1903.96 Crore has been released from Escrow fund for progressive and final mine closure plan for 283 proposals. In 2022-23, till Oct-22, Rs20.38 Crore has been released by CCO from escrow fund for 20 proposals.

Creating sustainable Post Mining land Use
CIL is committed to plan sustainable post mining land use in such a manner that it does not become liability but a source of income generation to the local community. The post mining land usage are planned giving due consideration of surrounding drainage pattern and landscapes. The forest areas are developed into good forests during post mining, forest density even richer than the original forests in some of the cases. The selection of tree species is carried out in consultation with local forest department officials.

MoU with Expert Agencies
The coal mining environmental issues are complex one and requires multi-disciplinary approach to address the same. It is observed that no single agency in India can claim to have the level of expertise and capacity to handle the environmental issues in an effective manner. In light of the above, CIL is having MoU with expert agencies of repute like NEERI, ICFRE etc. to assist in taking up various specific assignment of coal sector, research & development and capacity building of CIL executives in various emerging areas of environmental management.

Third party evaluation of Compliance of EC Conditions
In order to make assessment of environmental compliance being undertaken by subsidiaries of CIL, third party evaluation of compliance conditions has been entrusted to Indian Council of Forest Research and Education, Dehradun. In the first phase, 20 opencast mines spanning across all the subsidiaries of CIL were selected for this purpose and ICFRE has conducted the audit for evaluation of EC Compliance.
 
Assessment of change in carbon footprint on construction and operationalization of Tori - Shivpur Railway Line in CCL

The issue of global warming is indeed a serious global concern. In the current scenario greenhouse gases play a crucial role over increment of average temperature of our earth day by day. CIL had engaged CSIR-NEERI for estimation of carbon footprint of road transport & rail transport process and escalation or reduction in carbon footprint after implementation of rail-transfer process. The study found that, replacing truck haul with rail haul would lead to reduction in carbon footprint of about 16% in Magadh OC and Amrapali OC mines vis s vis road transport.

Study for projection of benefits of mechanized conveyor belt and silo loading system in coal loading and transport activities under First Mile Connectivity project
CIL aims to replace the existing road transport between pit head and dispatch points and switch over to a seamless mechanized coal transport through conveyor belts, a covered system for coal movement reducing dust pollution. CIL had engaged CSIR- NEERI for projection of benefits of mechanized conveyor belt and silo loading system in coal loading and transport activities. The study found that commissioning of FMC related infrastructure and activities have led to environmental benefits in terms of reduction in air pollution, reduction in CO2-carbon footprint and reduction in ambient sound levels.
As per study conducted in Lingraj OC, by dispatching 16 MT through SILO, reduction in CO by 72.2%, Hydro Carbon by 70.8%, NOx by 76.8%, PM10 by 72.3% and PM2.5 by 71.8% will be achieved as compared to emission of pollutants through road transport. Total annual Diesel savings of 58,38,309 liters for reduced movement of payloader and tipper amounting to 50.19 Crore. Annual saving for reduced transportation cost is 54.52 Crore.
As per study conducted in Gevra OC, during 2020-21, 9.66 MT has been dispatched through SILO thereby achieving reduction in CO by 83.7%, Hydro Carbon by 83.3%, NOx by 85.3%, PM10 by 84.1% and PM2.5 by 83.8% as compared to emission of pollutants through road transport. Total annual Diesel savings of 26,95,736 liters for reduced movement of payloader and tipper amounting to 23.08 Crore. Annual saving for reduced transportation cost is 42.10 Crore.
 
Environmental Performance Indexing
Coal India Limited (CIL) has a dedicated Sustainable Development Policy (SDP) effective from August 2013 with the commitments to protect and safeguard the environment. CIL is abiding by all the conditions stipulated in EC conditions. CIL through ICFRE has finalized the way forward to assess the environmental performance of its mines. Accordingly, ICFRE has developed two scores i.e. Environmental Management Index and Environmental Performance Index which is approved by CIL Board. ICFRE is undertaking the job of auditing and thereafter ranking of 35 mines of CIL based on the approved methodology. The same will be progressively implemented in all the mines of CIL.

Source Apportionment Study by NEERI for Jharia Coalfield

Source Apportionment Study conducted for Jharia coalfield by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). Final Report has been submitted by NEERI. Study as per report suggests that contribution of PM10 and PM2.5 by coal mining varies from 6% (winter) to 8% (summer) and 5% (winter) to 7% (summer) respectively. Major contribution of PM10 and PM2.5 is from transport section and domestic combustion which jointly contribute from 38% (winter) to 40% (summer) for PM10 and 49% (winter) to 53% (summer) for PM2.5.

Benefits will accrue from better utilization of resources and improvement in the overall environmental regime of the area where the mines are located.
New Initiative – From Waste to Resource Utilization of surplus Mine Water-
⚫	During its normal course of operation, water is being pumped out from mine to win the coal in both the systems i.e. Opencast & Underground mines because coal seams normally exists below the aquifers.
⚫	This pumped out water is discharged to surface and utilized for domestic purpose in CIL colonies along with industrial usage required in the mining operations.
•	Rest of the water is discharged through the settling tank established in surrounding mine premises from where it is discharged to the nearby seasonal or perennial nullahs, which in turn being used by the local farmers for cultivating the land and also during its course of flow it recharges the ground water table of surrounding areas to some extent. Besides this usage still some water flows to the rivers, which is a sheer wastage of natural resources so far as the surrounding villages are concerned.
•	In 2022-23, till Oct-22, the mine water discharged from mines of different subsidiaries of CIL is catering to the surrounding population (no. of population catered 11.22 Lakh). The total no. of villages catered is 837. During 2021-22, mine discharge was about 6047 LKL of which about 46% was shared for community use.
Overburden to Sand:

Most of Indian coal deposits occur in major river basins of Central India, like Damodar, Wardha, Hasdeo etc. Sand is essential ingredient for construction of housing colonies and commands huge demand. Currently it is met through sand mining and dredging from water courses of rivers. This affects the eco-system of rivers and is preventable. We have taken proactive steps in this direction and started segregating sand from our overburden formations.
 
Currently, two OB to sand plants are operational in WCL. The sand segregated from OB formations is being provided to agencies which are implementing housing under government schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and the likes. About 22,287 m3 of sand was generated from 55,719 Cu m OB in FY 2021-22. CIL is committed to implement the same in its other subsidiaries in a phased manner. 7 sand segregation plants are under process of installation in subsidiaries of CIL
The commissioning of sand segregation plants will improve the riverine ecosystem, improve the flow, accelerate ground water recharge potential and quality of water flowing in their courses. Sand segregation plants will go a long way in preventing mining / dredging of river courses which will be CIL’s contribution to Mother Nature
